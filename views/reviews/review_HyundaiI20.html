                The Hyundai i20 uses a completely new platform that was created at Hyundai's European technical centre
                in RÃ¼sselsheim to allow Hyundai to move into Europe's highly competitive subcompact B segment. A 2,525
                mm (99.4 in) wheelbase helps endow the i20 with a generous passenger cabin. Suspension follows the
                supermini norm of MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam rear end, with rack and pinion
                steering. A slightly upgraded version of the i20, called the iGen i20, went on sale in India in March
                2012 onward
                with tweaked headlamps, new front grille, tail lamps, and fog lamps. It follows the "Fluidic Sculpture"
                design philosophy with slightly re tuned engines. A new next generation model, known as Elite i20 in
                India, was launched in India on August 11, 2014, and was launched in Europe in the 2014 Paris Motor Show
